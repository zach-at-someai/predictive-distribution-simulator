# Charlotte — Predictive Distribution Simulator

Interactive demo showing how Charlotte turns ISG from a reactive parts distributor into a predictive one.

## What It Does

Simulates 12 months of equipment monitoring across 6 industrial compressors in ISG's portfolio. Charlotte watches signal drift (vibration, temperature, pressure) and generates proactive service quotes before equipment fails — capturing revenue and preventing downtime.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build tools or dependencies required.

- **Play/Pause** — Start or stop the simulation
- **Speed** — 1x, 2x, or 4x playback speed
- **Timeline** — Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to a specific month
- **Reset** — Return to the beginning
